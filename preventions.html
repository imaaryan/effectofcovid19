<h3>To prevent the spread of COVID-19:</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5> 

 Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub. <br> <br>
Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing. <br> <br>
Wear a mask when physical distancing is not possible. <br> <br>
Don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth. <br> <br>
Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze. <br> <br>
Stay home if you feel unwell. <br> <br>
If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention. <br> <br>


</h5>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
       	<p> Calling in advance allows your healthcare provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This protects you, and prevents the spread of viruses and other infections.
 </p>
        

        	<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Masks</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
       	<p> Masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from the person wearing the mask to others. Masks alone do not protect against COVID-19, and should be combined with physical distancing and hand hygiene. Follow the advice provided by your local health authority. </p>
