       	  <h3>Negative impact of Corona Virus on India</h3>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> 

    The number of COVID-19 infections in India has risen sharply over the past few days to more than 9000 cases. <br> <br>
    India’s economy has taken a beating. Sectors like tourism have seen huge losses in the past few months. <br> <br>
    In India, it is estimated that a huge part of the workforce (nearly 50 million people) has been laid off. The unemployment rate in India has shot up to 23.4%. <br> <br>

<h3>Positive impact of Corona Virus on India</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
        	<p> 
			India’s too has derived some pleasant benefits from the lockdown and the halt of human activity- <br> <br>
			Nitrogen dioxide fell by 40-50% in all the metro cities. PM (particulate matter) 2.5 and PM 10 levels too have slid. Since factories are closed and transportation is not required, India’s AQI (Air Quality Index) is improving. <br> <br>
			The rivers of India have to bear the brunt of our inadequate waste disposal means. But ever since the lockdown was imposed, the water quality level of the Ganga and the Yamuna has improved and the chemical pollution level has dipped. <br> <br>
			Nearly 4.75 Lakh (the highest number in many years) Olive Ridley turtles have made their nests in the     Rushikulya beach of Odisha due to empty beaches. <br> <br>
			The world has changed and we don’t know when this crisis will pass. All we can do is cooperate with our governments and actively practise social distancing to stay safe. <br> <br>
